## Biography
### The University of Texas at Austin
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UT Austin in the [UTOPIA Research Group](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu/) group.
I am working with [Işıl Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/), [Anders Miltner](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amiltner/), and [Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/).
Our work titled [Bottom-up Synthesis of Recursive Functional Programs using Angelic Execution](https://popl22.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2022-popl-research-papers/21/Bottom-up-Synthesis-of-Recursive-Functional-Programs-using-Angelic-Execution) received a distinguished paper award and a reusable artifact badge at POPL 2022.

### Carnegie Mellon University
I completed my senior thesis titled [Classification and Automaticity of Discrete Dynamical Systems](https://csd.cs.cmu.edu/thesis_topics/Adrian_Trejo) under the supervision of [Klaus Sutner](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sutner/), for which I was awarded the [Allen Newell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~newellaward/ugrad_award/) and thus graduated with School of Computer Science Honors.
I graduated with University Honors for both degrees.

I worked with [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/) on problems in Queueing Theory.

I worked with [Dave O'Hallaron](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~droh/) on systems problems involving automatic grading of student assignments using individual virtual machines on a cluster of machines (a precursor to containerization and Kubernetes).
