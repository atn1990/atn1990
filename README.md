## Biography
### The University of Texas at Austin
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UT Austin in the [UTOPIA Research Group](http://utopia.cs.utexas.edu/) group.
I am fortunate to have [Işıl Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) as my advisor.
I am also working with [Anders Miltner](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~amiltner/)
and
[Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/).
I received my MS in Computer Science in 2021.

### Carnegie Mellon University
I completed my BS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University in May 2013.
I completed my senior thesis titled [Classification and Automaticity of Discrete Dynamical Systems](https://csd.cs.cmu.edu/thesis_topics/Adrian_Trejo) under the supervision of [Klaus Sutner](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sutner/), for which I was awarded the [Allen Newell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~newellaward/ugrad_award/) and thus graduated with School of Computer Science Honors.
I graduated with University Honors for both degrees.

I worked with [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/) on problems in Queueing Theory.
I worked with [Dave O'Hallaron](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~droh/) on systems problems involving autograding student assignments using VMs on a cluster of machines (a precursor to containerization and Kubernetes).
